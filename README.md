# Kia-iOS-Shortcuts

This project provides a simple API to control your Kia vehicle using the Hyundai Kia Connect API. It includes features such as starting and stopping the climate control, locking and unlocking the car, and listing vehicles.

---
## Intro

This uses the Kia API written in Python. It was developed specifically for iOS shortcuts, though it may also work on Android OS. This allows for shortcuts to:

- Lock Vehicle  
- Unlock Vehicle  
- Start Climate  
- Stop Climate  

This uses the following Python package: [Hyundai Kia Connect API](https://github.com/Hyundai-Kia-Connect/hyundai_kia_connect_api).

### 5. Create IOS Shortcuts
You can create an iOS Shortcut to interact with your Kia Vehicle Control API easily. Follow these steps to set up your Shortcut:

    1. Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.
    2. Tap the "+" to create a new shortcut.
    3. Tap "Add Action".
    4. In the search bar, type "Get Contents of URL" and select it.
    5. Set the following options for the "Get Contents of URL" action:
        - URL: Enter the URL of your deployed API endpoint (e.g., https://your-api-url.com/start_climate).
        - Method: Choose POST (or GET if the endpoint requires GET).
        - Headers: Tap "Add New Field" and enter:
            - Key: Authorization
            - Value: YourCustomSecretKeyHere (replace this with your actual secret key).
    6. In the search bar, type "Show Result" and select it. (shows Contents of URL)
    7. Tap the drop-down arrow at the top of the shortcut to Rename and Choose Icon.
    8. Tap Done to save the shortcut.
    9. Run the Shortcut: When you run the shortcut, it will send a request to your API, performing the action you configured (e.g., starting the climate control or unlocking the car).

## Notes

The API requires your **region**. By default, it is set to the USA. If you are outside the US, update it using the following region codes:

REGIONS = {
    1: REGION_EUROPE,
    2: REGION_CANADA,
    3: REGION_USA,
    4: REGION_CHINA,
    5: REGION_AUSTRALIA }



The climate command requires a Climate Request Option. By default, it is set to 72°F for 10 minutes, but you can modify this based on your preferences.
